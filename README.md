# React Form Handling Project
This project showcases a React application for handling form inputs efficiently. It includes form components built with React hooks and demonstrates how to manage form state, perform input validation, and handle form submission.

# Features:
 - Form Inputs: Various types of form inputs such as text fields, password fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, select dropdowns, and text areas are implemented.
 - State Management: Utilizes React's useState hook to manage form state dynamically as users interact with the form.
 - Input Validation: Implements input validation for password, phone number, and email fields using custom validation logic.
 - Error Handling: Displays validation errors dynamically as users interact with the form, providing instant feedback on input validity.
 - Form Submission: Handles form submission by sending form data to a server endpoint using the POST method.

# Usage:
 - Clone the repository to your local machine.
 - Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using npm install.
 - Run the application locally using npm run dev.
 - Access the application in your web browser.
 - Interact with the form inputs to observe real-time validation feedback and form submission functionality.
